# Voices in My Head

This is a voice-controlled game that was made using SwiftUI and machine learning in Xcode 12. This game lets players battle a boss using nothing but their voice! Commands can be given to attack the opponent, or to heal the player.

There are HP bars for the boss and the player. Whichever one tackles the other to 0 HP first wins!
